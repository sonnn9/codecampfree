/**
 * Student is a small, immutable domain model.
 *
 * Key points:
 * - All fields are final, so once a Student is created its state cannot change.
 * - Equality and hash code are based on id only (identity semantics by id).
 *   That means two Student objects with the same id are considered equal,
 *   even if name, age, major, or gpa differ.
 * - toString prints a compact, human-friendly line for logs and debugging.
 *
 * When to use:
 * - Safe as a value placed in collections (List, Set, Map).
 * - Because it's immutable, it is naturally thread-safe for read sharing.
 *
 * Caveats:
 * - If your application assigns ids later (e.g., after saving to a database),
 *   be careful: objects put into a HashSet/HashMap before id is assigned
 *   will behave incorrectly if id changes. Here id is final, so that scenario
 *   is impossible with this class.

Usage tips:

1) As a key in HashMap/HashSet:
   Because equals/hashCode use id only and id is final, Student works well as a key.
   Example:
     Map<Student, Double> attendance = new HashMap<>();

2) In lists and sorting:
   If you need to sort by GPA then name, use a Comparator:
     Comparator<Student> byGpaDescThenName =
         Comparator.comparingDouble(Student::getGpa).reversed()
                   .thenComparing(Student::getName);

3) Validation:
   For robust domain models, consider validating constructor arguments
   or use a factory that enforces invariants.

4) Floating-point accuracy:
   GPA is a double for simplicity. If you need precise decimal arithmetic,
   consider BigDecimal with a defined scale and rounding mode.
